		<h2>Getting through tonight together</h2>
		<p>Johnson’s Baby were looking to increase awareness of their sleep products and their expertise in baby sleep routine. To accomplish this, a product would need to be developed that  would help parents when they needed it most.</p>

		<h2>A place to get support</h2>
		<p>Parents need help the most when their baby has trouble sleeping. Being up late at night and not knowing what to do can make them feel all alone. That’s why a chatroom was chosen. It would allow parents to connect with one and other. To keep each other company and provide advice.</p>

		<p>A wealth of other resources were also available to parents. The Reading Room provided links to helpful articles and the Nurses Office provided quick access to the Tresillian help line, Australia’s largest child and family health organisation.</p>

		<h2>Illuminating the night</h2>
		<p>Initially Night Light was only going to be a chatroom. Once it was decided that it would only be open between 5pm and 5am, as a way to differentiate it from places like Facebook, their needed to be some sort of content for users to see during the day. From that, the Reading Room was born.</p>

		<p>The art direction was specifically chosen to be easy on the eyes at night. Instead of being completely dark, there are warm purples and creams which are inviting and friendly.</p>

				<p>It was important that when people entered the chatroom they could display how they were feeling to other users so everyone could be a little more considerate if someone was having a hard time. Three different moods were chosen and initially they were labelled, but by launch the labels were removed to let users infer their own meanings.</p>
				<p>Upon entering the chatroom, each user is randomly assigned a different colour to help differentiate who is talking.</p>

			<h5>Real estate app</h5>
			<h1>Kohab</h1>
			<p>Kohab is a platform that takes finding a property from lots of lists and links shared on different platforms to a new social experience where friends and partners can come together in the one place and find their dream property. Boards are innovative within the real estate marketplace and this concept had to be brought to mobile so users could take their boards with them to inspections.</p>

				<h5>Solution</h5>

				</div>
				<h2>All that you need</h2>
				<p>You need to have a good reason to have a native app when you have a good experience on your responsive website. The Kohab app was designed with this in mind. The features of the platform were cut down to the core needs of a user who is going to see properties. This made for a really streamlined experience.</p>
				
				<div class="row" id="today">
					<img src="today.png" alt="Image of the Today screen showing upcomming inspections" class="device">
					<aside>
						<h3>Today</h3>
						<p>Today was created to give the app a home screen. Relevant information like inspections that are happening today and recent comments by other users on shared boards appear here so they are immediately at hand.</p>
						<p>Curated content like public boards which are created by real estates and insight articles by Kohab also have a place here, tailored to the user.</p>
					</aside>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row" id="boards">
					<aside>
						<h3>Boards</h3>
						<p>What differentiates boards from other real estate platforms. Boards allow users to create visual groups of properties for different purposes, compare properties with a board, and most importantly chat about the properties. Saving the hassle of sharing links on other services.</p>
					</aside>
					<img src="board.png" alt="Image of a board displaying 3 properties inside it" class="device">
				</div>
				
				<div class="row" id="inspections">
					<img src="property.png" alt="Image of a property that has an inpsection at 10 AM" class="device">
					<aside>
						<h3>Inspections</h3>
						<p>The go to place to see all your upcoming inspections. From here you can add inspections to your calendar as well as get directions to the property.</p>
					</aside>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row" id="chat">
					<aside>
						<h3>Chat</h3>
						<p>Another defining feature of the platform is chat. On other platforms if I found a property I wanted to talk about with someone I would need to copy the link and paste it in some other service like WhatsApp. This is a problem because links could be in different places and are easy to get lost in the flow of a conversation. Chat on Kohab solves this by moving all of this to a central location.</p>

					</picture>
					<aside>
						<h3>Notifications</h3>
						<p>Keeping users informed is important. That’s why there are several different notifications that the app can generate. All of them are rich notifications which allow a user to take action without even having to open the app.</p>

				<h5>The Process</h5>
				<h2>Going fast</h2>
				<p>This project had a very tight turn around time of 5 days. Just 5 days to design a whole iOS app and make the Android counterpart. The app is based off the already existing website but needed to be tailored to a specific set of usecases otherwise users would just use the responsive website. I decided the best hook was in the moment usecases like going to an inspection and notifications to support that.</p>
				
				<div class="grid">
					<img src="sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketching out the boards section of the app">
					<img src="sketch2.jpg" alt="sketching out a new homepage for the Kohab website">
					<h4 class="caption">Sketching out the app as well as a new homepage</h4>
				</div>
				
				<p>With such a tight deadline creating a system of components was key to successfully delivering on time. Once a library of components was created, it was easy to roll out different screens. All components were created with responsive constraints so they could easily be resized for different resolutions.</p>

		<h2>Opening up a new market</h2>
		<p>For as long as there have been ticket sales there has been a secondary market for unwanted tickets. With new laws introduced recently to cap the price of resold tickets at 10% of their original face value, Ticketek felt it was the right time to enter the secondary market with Marketplace.</p>

		<h4 class="type">The Solution</h4>
		<h2>Real fans, real tickets</h2>
		<p>Marketplace is the premiere destination for Ticketek ticket holders to resell their tickets if they are unable to attend an event. Their ticket information is already present within their account so putting a ticket up for sale is as simple as selecting the tickets and then setting a price whereas other platforms require users to fill out a lengthy form.</p>

	  <img src="listing.jpg">
	  Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>		
</div>	
		<p>On the purchasing side of things Ticketek wanted to ensure two things, that tickets purchased are genuine and that pricing is ethical. All resold tickets are issued a new barcode so that only the new ticket holder can enter the venue. For ethical pricing because all listed Tickets are from Ticketek originally, the face value is already know so the 10% cap can not be exceeded.</p>

		<h3 class="subhead">Admin Portal</h3>
		<p>Ticketek wanted a custom backend to manage Marketplace. This backend was to be designed from the ground up to be purpose fit for the needs of the frontend as well as integrating with the current systems at Ticketek. The areas Admin Portal needed to be able to manage included: products and listings, customer and broker details, and financial matters like settlements and fees applied to listings.</p>

		<h2>Streamlined</h2>
		<p>When I joined the Marketplace the project was already under development but it was at a point where stakeholders realised the designs weren’t working well. There were issues with how the designs worked on mobile as well as the general flow of how users listed and purchased tickets.</p>

		<img class="colours" src="colours.svg" alt="Brand colours">
		<p class="center">With no design files or style guide in hand my first task was to create a new design system from scratch. The original design had hair-thin lines with unclear calls to action. My new system features bold lines, bold colours, and larger typography for easier reading. For Admin Portal it was decided to instead use an off the shelf bootstrap theme to speed up development</p>
		<img src="tools.png" srcset="tools.png, tools@2x.png 2x" alt="A diagram illustrating the flow of design to code using different tools explained below" class="tools">
		<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">One of the issues on the project was design handoff. Previously developers were being given designs from Axure printed out on paper which is not feasible. I introduced Sketch and Zeplin to the workflow which helped developers quickly rebuild the frontend to the new designs.</p>

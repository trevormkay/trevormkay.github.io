			<h2>Automating the busy work</h2>
			<p>Cubit Select helps Estimators find the best quote possible by providing tools to compare the quotes they receive from Suppliers. But all of this was a manual process. When Estimators wanted a quote they would need send out invites, receive quotes, and then manually input them in to Cubit Select. What if there was a better way?</p>

			<h2>Introducing the Supplier Portal</h2>
			<p>The Cubit Select Supplier Portal is a new way for Suppliers to receive invites and submit their bids. Both feature a brand new design language that is consistent and fit for the purpose. Let me walk you through how Estimators and Suppliers can work together using the Cubit Select platform:</p>
			<h3 class="subhead">Setting up the job</h3>
			<p>It all begins with setting up the project. Estimators divide projects up in to Trade Packages which are specific areas of work (this could be Plumbing, Excavation, Concrete Supply, Brick Labour, etc). Each Trade Package will be made up of individual items that are related to that area of work. This helps an Estimator cost out the project.</p>
			<h3 class="subhead">Sending an invite</h3>
			<p>Once all the Trade Packages are set up the Estimator can invite Suppliers to bid on a Trade Package. From here the Estimator can select which Suppliers they want to send bids to, who should be contacted, and supply any additional information or documents that the Suppliers would need to provide an accurate bid. The Suppliers will receive an email with their invitation.</p>
			<h3 class="subhead">Submitting a quote</h3>
			<p>In the invite email the Supplier can click an Accept Invite link which will take them to the Supplier Portal (a Decline Invite link is also provided so Estimators can be sure of the status of all invites they’ve sent out). The Supplier Portal provides access to all of the invites that a Supplier has accepted. They can work on each one providing quotes for each item in a Trade Package and any additional information they need to help the Estimator understand the quote they are submitting. It’s also really easy for Suppliers to keep track of the status of all the quotes they have submitted.</p>
			<h3 class="subhead">Comparing quotes</h3>
			<p>Once a Supplier submits a quote it will automatically be sent to Cubit Select where the Estimator can then compare quotes. Cubit Select provides multiple views to highlight and sift through the data.</p>

			<h2>Two sides of the same coin</h2>
			<p>To grow in to this fully automated platform where Estimators and Suppliers could seamlessly work with each other Cubit Select needed to be redesigned to better support this workflow. As more content and features were added the Information Architecture of the platform was not holding up. This required me to reflow the site structure to better accomodate the new functionality.</p>
			<p>We took this an opportunity to redesign the look and feel of the platform so there was a consistent language across both tool. The existing design of Cubit Select did not feel like a streamlined professional tool and struggled with the addition of new features. To solve this I chose an icon based navigation which allows for more features to be added over time, a monochrome look so that only immediately important functionality is highlighted, bolder iconography that was consistent, and a navigation structure that flowed with how you used the application.</p>

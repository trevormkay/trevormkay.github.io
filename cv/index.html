		<h2>Employment History</h2>
		<div class="job">
			<h5>January 2022 - Present</h5>
			<h3>Senior UI Designer at PropertyMe</h3>
			<p>I am currently working at PropertyMe improving the various touchpoints of the PropertyMe platform for Real Estate Agents, Property Owners, and Tenants.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="job">
			<h5>August 2020 - January 2022</h5>
			<h3>Senior UI/UX Designer at MiTek</h3>
			<p>Hired by Buildsoft, a subsidiary of MiTek, I was able to work on Cubit Estimating and Cubit Select. The Cubit Platform helps General Contractors in the construction industry estimate the cost of projects and connect with Suppliers. For Cubit Estimating I worked on a range of general improvements to the application and for Cubit Select I worked on a complete redesign of the application to enable new features to be included.</p>
			<p>After some time I was brought in to the MiMezz project to continue on work done by another Designer who had to move on to other projects. The MiMezz team was based in Denver which meant I had to work asynchronously with the team. I also helped out with the hiring process to expand the Product Design team.</p>

			<h5>August 2018 - August 2020</h5>
 			<h3>UI/UX Designer at Ticketek</h3>
			<p>Marketplace is a brand new platform from Ticketek for the secondary ticket market. Late in to the project I was brought in to overhaul the designs to meet responsive and user experience goals. As part of this work I improved the user flows and ease of use of the interface and created a design system that worked well on any device while maintaining a fresh modern appearance.</p>
			<p>Once Marketplace was completed I was retained to kick off the redesign of the Ticketek website. This was a massive undertaking as the Ticketek platform is huge and I was the sole designer for the project. I also worked on redesigning the app, improving digital tickets, and the introduction of a new feature to the platform, Ticket Sharing.</p>
			<p>My final project for Ticketek was a new Self Service platform called Client Hub. Ticketek was about to enter the UK market and being able to set up and manage your events yourself is a key expectation. Client Hub is designed to make this process as simple as possible with a step by step guide and key task prompts.</p>

			<h5>October 2016 - June 2018</h5>
 			<h3>Product Designer at Isentia</h3>
			<p>At Isentia I was brought in to modernise the design of an ageing platform, Mediaportal. Having not received a design refresh in the last 5 years I had to create a whole new design system that felt fresh and was more in line with the current Isentia brand. I applied this new look and feel to both the website and the mobile app. I routinely presented to key stakeholders, which included the CEO and the board. My work was user tested with clients, which helped to shape the final product.</p>

This involved producing a variety of digital and physical work. I was involved in projects at all the different stages a project can be in: UX, art direction, template rollout, front end build, template integration, and maintenance. I also created a lot of images for social channels. I worked with a wide range of tools including Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, Sass, Gulp, JIRA, Bamboo, Basecamp, Slack, and many more. Several projects were also run agile.</p>

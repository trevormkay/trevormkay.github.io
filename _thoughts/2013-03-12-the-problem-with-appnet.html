<p class="callout">This article was written before <a href="http://blog.app.net" target="_blank">App.Net was essentially sunsetted</a>. These are my thoughts on what could have helped the service in the early days. A lot of what I said was eventually done regardless of this article, but it just wasn't enough to bring users in. Read this article now in the aspect of marketing your product correctly in the first place. If people just don't understand it, they just wont use it.</p>
<p>App.Net has to be the most underrated and misunderstood service on the internet right now. Amazing things are going to be born out of it, but yet everyone just passes it off as a paid also-ran.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that there isn't something wrong with App.Net, because there is. It has nothing to do with being a paid service, or only having a small amount of users. It all comes down to marketing. From day one, App.Net has been marketed the wrong way. Which has been a real disservice to the service itself.</p>
<h2>First impressions do count</h2>
<p>They say we judge a person within 10 seconds of first seeing them. The same principle applies to apps, websites, and services. Unfortunately, this is just a part of human nature. The ambitions of Dalton Caldwell are commendable. He has created something that is beneficial and I would say is actually needed on the internet at this point in its lifetime. The problem is, he has told the story in all the wrong ways.</p>
<p>Going back to day one, Dalton put out a <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">blog post</a> about his dismay of what Twitter had become. He was upset over the fact that Twitter wanted to become a media company, that the good old days of a free-for-all API were no more. To which matches my own sentiments. I completely disagree with the direction that Twitter wants to take itself.</p>
<p>This post garnered a lot of positive discussion so Dalton next posted his proposal for App.Net. After a round of crowd funding, the service had it's finances in order and development began.</p>
<p>The problem starts right from that very first blog post. Dalton used the problems over at Twitter to frame the whole discussion. This has left a lingering concept of what people think Dalton wants App.Net to be.</p>
<h2>Problems usually begin at home</h2>
<a href="http://app.net" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/thoughts/blog_adn.png" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the App.Net homepage." /></a>
<p>To show that the App.Net API was viable, the first client produced was Alpha by App.Net itself. Alpha is the raw stream of posts from people you follow. In essence, it is Twitter. There really isn't any other way to put it. This would have been fine down the road, but like everything else up until this point, Alpha continued to frame App.Net as nothing more than a paid clone of Twitter.</p>
<p>This message problem continues today. The App.Net website was redesigned to give a better sense of what the service is and how it is beneficial. The website also tries to promote apps that use the API. The problem here is there is a mixed message, is the website trying to talk to users or developers? It's trying to do both. It would really be better to have separate websites for users and developers.</p>
<p>The first marketing message on the site is for users. It's telling them that App.Net is a social network, which users interpret as being just like Twitter or Facebook. Where in reality, App.Net is solely a Social API. App.Net should only facilitate 3rd-party social networks and social apps.</p>
<p>Users shouldn't be inferring that there is a 1st party social network that considers itself The App.Net Social Network. It would be much better to promote other social networks that are born from App.Net. This way users aren't gravitating towards App.Net itself, but the experiences that App.Net facilitates.</p>
<p>The website also doesn't give me any indication, at a glance, of what apps using the API can do. It only tells me that I need to use the service and a lot of apps to discover what I can actually do with App.Net. In a world where people leave a website if it doesn't load in 5 seconds, this isn't good enough. Users should be told up front of the unique things that you can do with App.Net apps.</p>
<p>The Core Values are below the fold of the website. All seven of them are fantastic but I don't think average users really care about this part of the service. They all use Facebook and Google without caring that their personal data gets sold all the time. I would distill these seven down in to one. One easy message that any user can digest and understand and value.</p>
<h2>What's in a name</h2>
<p>Names are things that humanity highly values at a subconscious level. We put so much importance in to names. So it's somewhat sad that App.Net itself has no name. App.Net is just a URL that was being used for an entirely different service before the App.Net API existed. Mind you, it's an awesome URL but it's not a name. It sounds strange to say "My app is built on top of the App.Net API" because we don't say "My app is built on top of the Facebook.com API" we just say "My app uses the Facebook API."</p>
<p>I understand why Dalton doesn't want to name the service. He has said to the effect that App.Net is something that sits in the background. The problem there is that you have multiple apps using the API and it is designed to share data between them. It would be nice for a way to uniquely identify the service/API with a unique name and logo.</p>
<h2>What it took?</h2>
<p>It actually took me quite a while to understand what App.Net is trying to be. When the crowd funding round began my opinion was in exact alignment with <a href="http://ihave50dollars.com">I have $50</a>. "Nobody wants to pay for Twitter!"</p>
<p>I had to listen to a podcast that Dalton was a guest on and also the actual App.Net podcast before I understood what App.Net really is. As a prospective user, I shouldn't have to go to such lengths to find the real message of what the service is. The website should tell me this up front. "Hey! We have a social API and some really cool apps are being made on top of it! Check them out!"</p>
<p>I am not the only one who has gone through this process. The new Free Tier really helps, but there is still the issue of no real benefit explanation up front. It just shouldn't be this hard to get it.</p>
<a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/thoughts/blog_facebook.png" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the Facebook signup page." /></a>
<p>Compare the sign up pages of Facebook and Twitter. Right there Facebook tells me I am going to get four things if I join and these are the benefits of those four things. Twitter tells me its' single benefit, find out what's happening. On both sites, the message is clear. As a user, I will get these things if I sign up.</p>
<h2>What App.Net should be promoting</h2>
<p>First up, here is what should not be promoted on the homepage anymore. Any app that only shows a users raw stream. This continues to fester the idea of App.Net being a paid Twitter.</p>
<p>Start promoting heavily unique experiences. Each one different from the other. Apps like: Patter, an IRC client using the group messaging section of the API; App.Net File Manager, a web-based file manager using the file section of the API; Vidcast, a group jukebox for YouTube videos; and Project Amy, a text/group messaging app that integrates in to Messages on OS X that also uses the group messaging section of the API.</p>
<p>Just those four show how versatile App.Net can be. These are the kind of apps that make you say, "Yes, I will pay you $36/year!"</p>
<h2>A new message</h2>
<p>I truly believe if the message was changed, everyone would stop having the discussion if App.Net is worth it or not. We could start discussing the cool apps being made with App.Net. Because that would be an infinitely more enjoyable topic.</p>

<p>The App Store is a crowded market. Gaining attention in this crowd is something that can be hard to do. One way a lot of devs go about gaining attention is through what I like to call, The Microsoft Way.</p>
<p>What is the Microsoft Way? Microsoft themselves give you a good overview:</p>

<p>Put simply, The Microsoft Way is about putting as many banners, stars and snipes on a package to gain shelf presence in a crowded market while making sure your brand is known. This may attract attention, but it severely detracts from the aesthetics of the package. Which is why Microsoft severely limited this practice when it introduced the packaging for Vista.</p>
<h2>How does this relate to the iPhone?</h2>
<p>The App Store may be virtual, but it acts just like a real store. There are shelves for all the products sold within and the packaging for each app is represented by an icon. Like any brick and mortar store, the App Store has become overcrowded with products. This has caused the side-effect of prices being rushed to the bottom. While that worked for a while, it is no longer enough to attract attention. Developers now have to find other ways to let you know about their apps. I've seen more and more developers employ The Microsoft Way of gaining attention. Quite frankly, this should be stopped.</p>
<h2>Banners, Stars, and Snipes</h2>
<p>Banners are most often applied to apps that are free or on sale. Usually a coloured bar in the lower third of the icon with some text. The problems with this method include: it detracts from the artwork of the icon, makes your iTunes page look cheap, and the banner stays on the icon when a user downloads the app to iTunes.</p>

<p>This screenshot is taken from Digital Chocolate's iTunes page. Digital Chocolate is one of the big game publishers for the iPhone. To garner more sales they create lite versions of their apps. Since they have a ton of apps, their page is littered with banner after banner. What is the problem with this?</p>
<ol>
	<li>It makes Digital Chocolate look cheap.</li>
	<li>I'm more attracted to the free apps than the paid apps.</li>
	<li>iTunes tells me the price of every app right next to it's icon. The only place this doesn't happen is in the Top Sales charts on the App Store home page.</li>
	<li>If a free app is in the Top Free Apps chart, I already know it's free. I don't need to be told twice.</li>
	<li>The banners stick with the icon when you download the app to iTunes since the App Store and iTunes itself use the iTunes Artwork file inside an IPA.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have downloaded an app with a banner, that banner stays on the icon until an updated version of the app in question is released. This makes my iTunes look cheap and gives me redundant information. I don't need to be told every time I look at my apps that I purchased the app while it was on sale, it was a free version, or the app has been improved</p>
<h2>Get off My Lawn</h2>
<p>An even worse practice is having a banner on the actual app icon. Not only does it show up in the iPhone version of the App Store but it also dirties my home screens. With Spotlight available, I'll gladly move your app to the very last page so I don't have to see it. I'm also less likely to download your app in the first place.</p>

<p>As you can see from this screenshot, there is no need to place a banner on the app icon. The store tells me in big bold letters that the app is FREE. It looks even sillier in the Top 25 Free Apps list.</p>
<h2>Being on Brand</h2>
<p>Some developers have the nasty habit of making sure you know they made the app. When you have a page full of apps with branding on them it looks like a convention full of "Hello My Name Is" badges. The most common offenders are game developers.</p>
<img src="../../images/thoughts/blog_iconBranding.png" />
<p>All of these icons feature some sort of branding. Included in this set are: the name of the app. the name of the developer, version number, and the name of a Social Gaming Network being used in an app. To include any of these on your icon is silly</p>
<p><b>Name of the App:</b> The name of your app is included underneath the icon. Why duplicate it?</p>
<p><b>Name of the Developer:</b> I don't need to know who developed the app each time I launch it. It's highly pretentious of you to include this on an icon.</p>
<p><b>Version Number:</b> The version number of any app should be included in an About page within the app, not on the icon. If you are still selling the old version alongside the new version (Like Aurora Feint was), make the two app icons visually different.</p>
<p><b>Social Gaming Network Logo:</b> The worst offender of them all. If your app is Plus+ or OpenFeint enabled, tell me in the app description within it's iTunes page, NOT on the app icon. Rolando had one of the most beautiful icons in the App Store and they ruined it by adding a Plus+ logo. Ngmoco:) then proceeded to do this with their other prized icon, Star Defence.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>The solution for this problem is simple. Don't do it. Apps should be able to speak for themselves. If you can't sell your app on features and word of mouth marketing, then you should take a good hard look at your app.</p>

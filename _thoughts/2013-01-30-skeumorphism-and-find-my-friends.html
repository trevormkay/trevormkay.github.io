<p class="callout">This article was written before the flat redesign of iOS when we were all arguing if textures were a bad thing or not.</p>
<p>iMore recently posted an <a href="http://www.imore.com/no-more-skeuomorphs" target="_blank">article</a> of what iOS would look like if skeuomorphism (read textures) was removed. In the absence of these textures, it was suggested an aluminium theme should be adopted. Similar to the one that iOS 6 Maps uses.</p>
<h2>Why is this even an issue?</h2>
<p>The issue at hand is that Apple has been so heavy handed with textures and real world objects. Book shelves, leather, real-to-real tape decks, notepads, etc. To Apple's credit, these are all finely detailed in their respective apps (Especially the Podcasts app. The amount of detail in the workings of that tape deck is astounding).</p>
<p>People however, now feel this is all too much. They feel it is tacky, tasteless, and childish. They want all of this ripped out in favour of something OS X-like or Metro-like.</p>
<h2>iMore's Take</h2>
<p>In the article, Rene did something nobody else has really done before when it comes to this debate. He posted mockups of what apps would look like if they were re-skinned. His base was the iOS 6 Maps app.</p>

<p>The Maps theme is alright. It is the same silver as the default iPad theme. Unfortunately it looks bland as a default. If you wanted to go all silver, I'd try the iPhoto theme. It has more warmth to it.</p>
<p>Applying this aluminium theme to Find My Friends, iBooks, and Game Center is hit and miss for me. Find My Friends works okay because it has no analogue. iBooks and Game Center however look like they had the life sucked out of them. They are a shell of what they once were. This is not the way to solve this problem.</p>
<h2>Why Skeuomorphism works on Touch Screens</h2>
<p>Now say it with me, "Textures are not bad. Textures are not evil. We should not be ashamed to use textures." Textures make an app friendly. They make an app recognizable. They help to brand an app. These are all commendable things and shouldn't be forgotten just because of the latest fad.</p>
<p>I hear you say, Consistency!? Yes, consistency is important. We get this trait in app design from desktops. But thematic consistency is not as important on a touch screen OS. Touch screen apps are (currently) no-distraction experiences. Only one app takes up the screen at a time. This means you are focused on just a single app.</p>
<p>Desktop apps on the other hand run windowed. The reason why you want thematic consistency there is so no app sticks out like a sore thumb distracting you. But due to the nature of the no-distraction experience on iOS, this issue just never arises.</p>
<p>Where consistency comes in is with platform conventions. Your buttons should be in obvious places, you should follow patterns, your iconography should be consistent, etc. Being consistent with these areas of app design will make your app feel right at home. Using the default theme is nice, but not necessary.</p>
<h2>How to tone it down. My take on Find My Friends</h2>
<p>I feel sorry for the Find My Friends app. It is constantly harassed and called names. It only wants to help you. So let's help it out.</p>
<p>To start off with, this is not what I think Apple should do. Apple have many talented designers and those of us outside of Apple do not know what the brief was for the app. This is only how I would design the app if it was my job to. Click the following mockups for a larger view.</p>

<p>It has been said by Sebastian de With (who was on the team who designed Find My Friends) that the reason the app uses such heavy chrome is because it is such a data heavy app, inferring there is no content. I disagree with this. There is plenty of content to be found. </p>
<p>iOS 6 includes gorgeous looking maps that should be put front and center. By doing this, I have eliminated most of the chrome. No need for fancy stitching or any other decorations to fill in the app. The map does all the filling in.</p>
<p>The other piece of content is our friends. They are the primary use case of the app. By moving the contacts list in to a horizontal scroller (like that found in the iOS 6 App Store) I have been able to make the best use of space and allow more of the map to be shown. As an added touch, the pins now show contact photos. This is to make it easier to see at glance where your friends are.</p>
<p>The app itself still includes texture. Instead of using heavy leather and stitching, I've gone for subtle cardboard. I chose cardboard because I wanted to evoke the colours of the original app. Colour was never the problem.</p>
<p>On the technical side of things, I consolidated the navigation. You get your own card now thats always first (You are at 0 millimetres away from your phone), so thats the Me tab gone. Requests also come in as new cards instead of being stacked in their own tab. Any options that were present for these tabs would be handled on detail views. I also renamed Temporary to Events. I felt it was a better fit.</p>
<a href="../../images/thoughts/blog_fmf_details_full.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../images/thoughts/blog_fmf_details.png" class="noborder" /></a>
<p>This is the detail view for each card. On the iPad the cards would flip around. Again, like in the iOS 6 App Store. I added a Map View to the top of the card, like iOS 6 Maps, to give a visual of the address.</p>
<p>So that's my take on the app. I'm sure others would do it wildly differently. My goal with this was to show there is actual content when you think there is none. Don't hide it, bring it forward. </p>
<h2>Good in moderation</h2>
<p>I hope this has shown you that textures aren't bad. They just need to be used in moderation. To remove them from iOS and go flat would just be responding to a fad. iOS would become a fashion victim.</p>

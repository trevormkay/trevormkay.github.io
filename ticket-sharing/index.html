		<h2>Safe and secure</h2>
		<p>Times have changed and venues need to know who is entering their doors and gates. Currently less than 50% of patrons are known to the venue. This means people are buying tickets and then sharing them with friends. Ticketek wanted to introduce a more secure method of sharing tickets that bound a shared ticket to an account.</p>

				<h4 class="type">The Solution</h4>
				<h2>A whole new way to share</h2>
				<p>To succeed in making tickets more secure, they need to be authenticated by the owner to view them. Also barcodes need to be locked down until the day of the event and constantly refresh. This prevents scalpers from screenshotting tickets and selling to multiple people. But to facilitate the legitimate use case of people buying tickets for friends, Ticket Sharing was introduced.</p>
				<h2 class="subhead">Sharing a ticket</h2>
				<p>Sharing is now integrated directly in to the ticket itself. A user can click the big share button and share a secure link to a friend. Once accepted that ticket is now bound to the friend’s account meaning venues know who’s entering.</p>
				<p>For the best experience sharing was also integrated in to the Ticketek app which allows users to select from their Contacts, meaning no copy and pasting.</p>

				<h2 class="subhead">Receiving a ticket</h2>
				<p>It’s just as easy to receive a ticket. You are sent an SMS or an email with a link. If you have the app installed you will be deeplinked in to the app to accept the ticket. Once accepted you can view it.</p>
				<p>The original purchaser still has control over the ticket, they can recall it at any time. The recipient can also return the ticket to the original purchaser if they need to</p>

		<p class="center">Tickets have been redesigned from the ground up to go along with the redesign of the <a href="../ticketek-site" target="_blank">Ticketek website</a>. This new design improves the information hierarchy of the tickets, is more consistent with the display of ticket information on the website, and feels at home with native wallet passes which were also redesigned as part of this project.</p>

		<h2>Continuing the journey</h2>
		<p>Performing user testing proved valuable. Through feedback on a <a href="../ticketek-site" target="_blank">different project</a>, it was learned that the old method of sharing tickets during the purchase pipeline was frustrating as it could result in cart timeouts if you were trying to share a lot of tickets. This helped inform us to make sharing available at any time after purchase.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p>During trials it was discovered that the design of the confirmation screen made it easy for users to confuse the confirmation screen with their new ticket. This screen was redesigned to remove the confusing element and focus on the primary call to action of going to view the ticket. It also gave me room to include a message about downloading the app.</p>

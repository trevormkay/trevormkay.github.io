description: "Ticketek represents a huge body of work for me. Two redesigned platforms, a new product, and many ancillary pieces that were required to support these. I was hired to work on Marketplace and then kept on to work on the redesign of the Ticketek website itself. I was the sole Designer on all of these projects."

			<h2>Ticketek Website</h2>
			<p>Ticketek has been around for 40 years and has been selling tickets to events online since 1997. Ticketek sells over 23 million tickets to more than 20,000 events each year including concerts, sports, theatre, musicals, festivals, exhibitions, experiences, and family events. It was time for this well known icon to not only get a new look. The current site was designed before responsive design existed and that showed in the fact that there was separate desktop and mobile sites.</p>

			<h2>Ticket Sharing</h2>
			<p>Times have changed and venues need to know who is entering their doors and gates. Currently less than 50% of patrons are known to the venue. This means people are buying tickets and then sharing them with friends. Ticketek wanted to introduce a more secure method of sharing tickets that bound a shared ticket to an account.</p>

			<h2>Marketplace</h2>
			<p>For as long as there have been ticket sales there has been a secondary market for unwanted tickets. With new laws introduced recently to cap the price of resold tickets at 10% of their original face value, Ticketek felt it was the right time to enter the secondary market with Ticketek Marketplace.</p>

		<h2>Laying a new foundation</h2>
		<p>Isentia is a market leader in the media monitoring game. Mediaportal has been providing brands with up to date mentions in the news for over 30 years. Having not received an update in the last 5 years it was time to introduce a new design system, called Recharge, to make Mediaportal to be competitive and feel like a modern platform.</p>

		<h4 class="type">The Solution</h4>
		<h2>Recharge</h2>
		<p>The goal of Recharge was to create something that was familiar to current users who are averse to change in their workflows but at the same time something that was fresh and clean looking. Mediaportal has many pieces and touchpoints so it was important to get all of these in line.</p>
		
		<h2 class="subhead">Monitor</h2>
		<p>The bread and butter of the platform is monitoring coverage. With users receiving more and more social media coverage, it was time to give this conerstone of the platform a fresh new look geared towards viewing social content.</p>

		<h2 class="subhead">Analyse</h2>
		<p>When talking with users it was becoming increasingly obvious that they wanted a more powerful analytics solution. An easier way to break down their coverage and quickly gain insights. The new dashboards allow users to filter their analytics by the topics they care about.</p>

				<h2 class="subhead">Report</h2>
				<p>Reports allow users to share coverage within their organisations. We found users were turning to other tools because the PDFs we provided weren’t easily sharable or easy to read on phones. This was solved by moving to a new web format.</p>

		<h2>Client driven design</h2>
		<p>Mediaportal is used by a wide range of clients. From big name brands, to government agencies, and even little PR firms. A client base so diverse meant it was important to interview a wide set of clients. Clients were shown various prototypes and their feedback helped to inform the final product.</p>

		<p class="center">The previous version of Mediaportal had issues like the navigation and hierarchy issues, as well as the website not being responsive.</p>

		<h2>Friction-Free retail management</h2>
		<p>As part of a redevelopment effort, beginning with the Eastland Shopping Centre, QIC were looking to create a next generation retail platform allowing retailers to manage all of their stores with QIC centres.</p>

		<h4 class="type">The Solution</h4>
		<h2>From small outlet to global retailer</h2>
		<p>A custom CMS was developed that focuses on retailers instead of centre management. A retailer can easily log in and see all the information relevant to their brand and each of their stores within QIC centres.</p>
		<div class="card">

			<h4 class="caption">Each piece of content within the system is a card</h4>
		</div>
		<p>The design of the CMS pushes towards a native app than a traditional CMS. This provides a richer and much more focused experience for retailers as they manage their stores.</p>

		<h4 class="type">The Process</h4>
		<h2>Bridging brands across platforms</h2>
		<p>Making the retailer portal a really fluid experience was important to me. I wanted users who came to the portal to feel like they could accomplish any edits they needed to do. This lead me to use a more app-like paradigm which made it easy to accomodate the breadth of options available for a user.</p>

		</div>
		<p>It was important for the client that this CMS felt a part of their brand. This really comes through in the use of typography and restricted colour. A baseline grid was also used to fully evoke the rigidity and structure of the QIC brand.</p>

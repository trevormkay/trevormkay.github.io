		<h3>Senior UI Designer at PropertyMe</h3>
		<h4>January 2022 - Present</h4>
		<p>Contracted by PropertyMe to work on various aspects of their property management platform. From improving how keys are managed at a real estate to helping tenants complete routine inspections by themselves. I worked on features in both their agency and consumer platforms. I also spent time improving the Design Systems to bring them inline with new Figma features like Component Properties.</p>

	<div class="job">
		 <h3>Senior UI/UX Designer at MiTek</h3>
		<h4>August 2020 - January 2022</h4>
		<p>Hired by Buildsoft, a subsidiary of MiTek, I was able to work on <a href="/cubit-estimating/" target="_blank">Cubit Estimating</a> and <a href="/cubit-select/" target="_blank">Cubit Select</a>. The Cubit Platform helps General Contractors in the construction industry estimate the cost of projects and connect with Suppliers. For Cubit Estimating I worked on a range of general improvements to the application and for Cubit Select I worked on a complete redesign of the application to enable new features to be included.</p>
		<p>After some time I was brought in to the <a href="/mimezz/" target="_blank">MiMezz</a> project to continue on work done by another Designer who had to move on to other projects. The MiMezz team was based in Denver which meant I had to work asynchronously with the team.</p>
		<p>I also helped out with the hiring process to expand the Product Design team.</p>

 		<h3>UI/UX Designer at Ticketek</h3>
		<h4>August 2018 - August 2020</h4>
		<p><a href="/marketplace" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> is a brand new platform from Ticketek for the secondary ticket market. Late in to the project I was brought in to overhaul the designs to meet responsive and user experience goals. As part of this work I improved the user flows and ease of use of the interface and created a design system that worked well on any device while maintaining a fresh modern appearance.</p>
		<p>Once Marketplace was completed I was retained to kick off the redesign of the <a href="/ticketek-site" target="_blank">Ticketek website</a>. This was a massive undertaking as the Ticketek platform is huge and I was the sole designer for the project. I also worked on redesigning the app, improving digital tickets, and the introduction of a new feature to the platform, <a href="/ticket-sharing" target="_blank">Ticket Sharing</a>.</p>
		<p>My final project for Ticketek was a new Self Service platform called Client Hub. Ticketek was about to enter the UK market and being able to set up and manage your events yourself is a key expectation. Client Hub is designed to make this process as simple as possible with a step by step guide and key task prompts.

	<div class="job">
 		<h3>Product Designer at Isentia</h3>
		<h4>October 2016 - June 2018</h4>
		<p>At Isentia I was brought in to modernise the design of an ageing platform, <a href="/mediaportal/" target="_blank">Mediaportal</a>. Having not received a design refresh in the last 5 years I had to create a whole new design system that felt fresh and was more in line with the current Isentia brand. I applied this new look and feel to both the website and the mobile app. I routinely presented to key stakeholders, which included the CEO and the board. My work was user tested with clients, which helped to shape the final product.</p>

I also created a lot of images for social channels. I worked with a wide range of tools including Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, Sass, Gulp, JIRA, Bamboo, Basecamp, Slack, and many more.

 		<h3>UI/UX Designer at Ticketek</h3>
		<h4>August 2018 - Present</h4>
		<p><a href="/marketplace" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> is a brand new platform from Ticketek for the secondary ticket market. Late in to the project I was brought in to overhaul the designs to meet responsive and user experience goals. As part of this work I improved the user flows and ease of use of the interface and created a design system that worked well on any device while maintaining a fresh modern appearance.</p>
		<p>Once Marketplace was completed I was retained to kick off the redesign of the <a href="/ticketek-site" target="_blank">Ticketek website</a>. This was a massive undertaking as the Ticketek platform is huge and I was the sole designer for the project. I also worked on redesigning the app, improving digital tickets, and the introduction of a new feature to the platform, <a href="/ticket-sharing" target="_blank">Ticket Sharing</a>.</p>

 		<h3>Product Designer at Isentia</h3>
		<h4>October 2016 - June 2018</h4>
		<p>At Isentia I was brought in to modernise the design of an ageing platform, <a href="/mediaportal/" target="_blank">Mediaportal</a>. Having not received a design refresh in the last 5 years I had to create a whole new design system that felt fresh and was more in line with the current Isentia brand. I applied this new look and feel to both the website and the mobile app. I routinely presented to key stakeholders, which included the CEO and the board. My work was user tested with clients, which helped to shape the final product.</p>
